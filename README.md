# LTreweighting
This repository allows to reproduce the figures of the paper Ventre et al. [1], which describe a method of trajectory inference for scRNA-seq data with lineage tracing. 
Note that some of the functions presented here are directly taken from two previously published papers, [2], and [3]: this is of course always specified in the files.
